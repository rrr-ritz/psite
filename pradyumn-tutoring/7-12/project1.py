# 1. Ask the user for 3 of their test scores 
# (out of 100) from school, and store 
# them in variables `test1`, `test2`, and `test3`.
# Hint: Use the input() function.





# Calculate the average score, store it in a 
# variable `average`, and print out the 
# following message:
# Your average score between the 3 tests was {average}.





# Use conditionals to print a custom message,
# depending on the average score the user got.
# Use the chart below to see what message to 
# print in each case:
