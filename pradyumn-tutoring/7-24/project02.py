PROJECT 2
---------

** Description: **
In this project, you'll develop a console calculator. There are two levels 
of difficulty, so that you can challenge yourself to take your skills to the 
next level and build something more complete. Refer to the demo on the website 
to see what your v1.0 and v2.0 should look like.

** Instructions (READ CAREFULLY!): **
[ v1.0 ]
1. Print the title, as shown in the demo.

2. Gather the first number, the operator, and the second number from the user 
and cast to a number as needed (hint: num1 and num2 should be floats).

3. Depending on the operator selected, perform the appropriate calculation 
and print out the entire number sentence and answer to the console using the 
format in the demos. The first version of your code should support addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division.

[ v2.0 ]
4. Extend your program to support exponentiation and modulus.

5. Ask the user after every calculation if they want to perform another one, 
and react accordingly (hint: you will need a loop of some sort).

6. Include the calculation number before each calculation. You'll need to keep 
incrementing this after each calculation is performed and shown to the user. 

7. Detect two types of invalid inputs: dividing by zero AND inputting an 
invalid operator (i.e. one other than + - * / ** %). Do not increase the 
calculation number if an invalid input occurs, and prompt the user again.

8. If the user decides to exit (by entering 'n' when asked to continue or not),
print out a goodbye message as shown in the demo.

9. Add any other features you think of! Have fun with it.
