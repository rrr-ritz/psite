PROJECT: Interactive Shopping List

Description:
In this project, you'll develop an interactive console-based shopping list. 
There are two levels of difficulty, so that you can challenge yourself to 
enhance your skills and build something more comprehensive.

Instructions (READ CAREFULLY!):
[ v1.0 ]

1. Print a welcome message and brief instructions for the user.

2. Use a while loop to let the user continuously add items to the list, view the 
current list, or quit the program.

3. If the user wants to add an item, check whether it's already on the list. 
If it is, print a message saying the item is already there. If not, add the 
item to the list.

[ v2.0 ]
4. Extend your program to allow the user to remove items from the list.

5. When the user asks to view the list, print each item on its own line with a 
number next to it, so the user can see how many items are on the list.

6. Detect invalid inputs (like removing an item that isn't on the list) and 
print an appropriate error message, without crashing the program.

7. If the user decides to quit, print a goodbye message.

8. Add any other features you think would be useful or fun. Be creative!
