							<i>For-each loops with lists/dictionaries</i><br>
							Learned the concept, did various tracing examples, followed

							<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZRI1IfStY0">Floating Point Precision</a>
							<p>
								This is a great video on how floating point numbers work, and their limitations.
								It's a really interesting look into how data is actually stored and represented 
								internally in a given computer. I highly, highly recommend this YouTube channel 
								-- Computerphile -- if you like this video. Check out the rest of their stuff!

					<strong><u>Monday, July 24</u></strong>
					<br><br>
				
					<u>Summary:</u>
					<ol>

						<li>
							<i>Review of homework from 7/12</i><br>
							Work was nearly perfect, and we talked about 
							minor adjustments to make the code better. 
							Great job! More difficult projects incoming...
						</li>

						<br>

						<li>
							<i>Exponent Properties intuition</i><br>
							We discussed the different properties of exponents 
							and the evolution of repeated operations, understanding 
							multiplication as repeated addition and exponentiation 
							as repeated multiplication. We did lightly scaffolded 
							but largely student-directed proofs/derivations of the 
							various key properties of exponents to better understand 
							the addition, subtraction, multiplication rules as well 
							as fractional and negative exponents.
						</li>

						<br>

						<li>
							<i>Exponent Properties practice</i><br>
							We practiced using the various properties in depth, 
							both individually and combining multiple into a problem.
							We also discussed strategies to improve pattern recognition 
							in the context of competitive math and improving problem solving.
						</li>

					</ol>

					<ul>

						<li>
							<a href="pradyumn-tutoring/7-24/exponent-rules.pdf">
								Exponent Properties Practice
							</a>
							<p>
								Make sure to neatly show your work below each 
								problem and box your answer clearly. Don't 
								forget to use the strategies of identifying powers 
								of a particular number to simplify your thought 
								process. Always find the most efficient way to 
								solve the problem!

							<p>
								Click the link to download the Python file that 
								contains 5 tracing practice problems of varying 
								difficulty. Make sure to put comments at critical 
								lines to keep track of the value of the specified 
								variables. There is an example in the file which 
								will clarify any doubts.

							<p>
								Click the link to download the starter Python file
								for your second project! 
								<br><br>
								In this project, you will create a console calculator. 
								There are two levels of difficulty, complete one at a time. 
								See project file for details. <br>

					<strong><u>Wednesday, July 12</u></strong>
					<br><br>
				
					<u>Summary:</u>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								<i>Context to start</i><br>
								Showed various examples of 
								the massive world of things you can 
								build with code.
							</p>
						</li>
				
						<li>
							<p>
								<i>Setup</i><br>
								Downloaded Python, VS Code, 
								necessary VSCode extensions, 
								overview of text editors vs. IDEs,
								the command line, general 
								understanding of the compiler, etc.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								<i>Review of basics</i><br>
								Went through review of familiar 
								concepts like variables (understanding
								variables as a box), conditionals 
								(branching your code), loops 
								(to increase readability and efficiency),
								functions (for modularization), and a 
								few smaller topics.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								<i>Tracing code</i><br>
								Deep dive into tracing for most of class.
								Importance of understanding the structure
								of your code and strategies to walk through
								it with tracing to optimize and debug your
								code.
